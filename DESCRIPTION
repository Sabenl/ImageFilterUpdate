Description: A package that contains different image filters to apply to you image.
    Contains four different filters; grayscale, cutoff, red/green/blue and chosen 
    color based on RBG values. Provide the path to your image and the package will
    enable you to apply the different filters and save the image to your directory.
    You need to load your image path to the object "image_path" and load both the 
    magick and ImageFilter library. Then you can use the provided "apply_filter"
    functions to generate a filtered image which can then be saved.
